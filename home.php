		<h2><u> ABOUT US </u></h2>
	</center>

		We eat, we sleep, we work, we travel, moving continuously to the rhythm of the clockwork universe that we are a part of.
		And in the middle of this, each day we face a multitude of questions within us. Certain questions have the power to create
		formidable ideas, and we at Shaurya Racing, are here today because of one such exciting question which forced us to step
		out of our construct and build something great. We asked ourselves, 'How can we make lives better, by doing what we love and
		by letting people do what they love?'. We began exploring what exists out there and within us, and after countless
		ruminations about consumerism, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, social psychology, disruptive technologies and Ikigai we realised
		that we want to swim with the tide, but in a much better way - through motorsports.

		<br>
		We know what we love - making cars and we know what people love - to race around on them and we realised that the
		natural next step for us is to make them accessible.
